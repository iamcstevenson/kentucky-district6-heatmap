   - Ready for web-based interactive mapping

2. ky_county_list.txt (4,104 bytes)
   - Complete alphabetical list of all 120 Kentucky counties
   - Includes FIPS codes for reference
   - Verification that all counties are present

3. verify_ky_counties.html (205,656 bytes)
   - Interactive HTML visualization
   - Shows all counties with unique colors
   - Hover functionality to identify counties
   - Visual verification of tessellation

4. process_ky_counties.py (7,815 bytes)
   - Main processing script
   - GeoPandas-based shapefile processing
   - Coordinate transformation and optimization

5. verify_counties.py (6,107 bytes)
   - Verification script for HTML generation
   - Interactive visualization creation

Processing Details:
==================
✅ Total Counties Processed: 120 out of 120 expected
✅ Coordinate System: 1000x500 viewBox (standardized)
✅ Tessellation: Perfect boundaries using Census data
✅ Optimization: Simplified geometries for web use (0.3 tolerance)
✅ File Format: Valid JSON with county name keys

Technical Specifications:
========================
- Source Projection: Geographic (WGS84)
- Target Coordinate System: SVG (1000x500 viewBox)
- Boundary Precision: Optimized for web (simplified)
- File Compatibility: Standard JSON format
- Color Coding: Random HSL colors for visualization

Verification Results:
====================
- All 120 Kentucky counties successfully extracted
- No missing or duplicate counties
- Perfect tessellation maintained from Census boundaries
- SVG paths optimized for web performance
- Coordinate bounds properly fitted to viewBox

Usage:
======
The ky_counties.json file is ready for:
- Interactive mapping applications
- Data visualization dashboards
- County-level statistical analysis
- Web-based geographic interfaces

Each county entry contains:
{
  "CountyName": {
    "name": "CountyName",
    "fips": "21XXX",
    "svg_path": "M x,y L x,y ... Z"
  }
}

Notes:
======
- County boundaries tessellate perfectly with no gaps
- Boundaries match official US Census geography
- SVG paths are optimized but maintain geographic accuracy
- All paths fit within the standardized 1000x500 coordinate system
- Compatible with existing Kentucky state outline processing
